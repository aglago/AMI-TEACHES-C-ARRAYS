      <p class="topic">ARRAYS</p>
      <p class="content">
        In C/C++, an array is a collection of data items of the same datatype
        stored at contiguous memory locations.Each data item in an array is
        called an element and can be reference randomly by indices(later looked
        at). An example of an array is as follows. <br />

      </p>

      <p class="topic">Declaring an array</p>
      <p>
        In declaring an array, use the format data_type array_name[size]; <br />

        <br />
      </p>

      <p class="topic">Initializing an array</p>
      <p>
        There are two ways an array can be initialized. <br/>
        i. Initializing with declaration <br/>
        ii. Initializing with indices <br/>

        <p class = "topic"> Initializing with declaration</p>
        Once an array is declared, it can be initialized by stating the values of
        the elements in braces, separating each element with a comma. <br /> <br/>
        <img src="ARRAY3.jpg" /> <br />
        In this method of initialization, you can choose to skip defining the size of 
        the array, that way, you can insert as many elements as you can into the array.

      </p>
      
      <p class = "topic"> Initializing with indices </p>
      In this case, the value for each each index is stated separately after the array
      has been declared. But before that,
      what are indices? Let us look at how indices work in arrays. <br />
        <br />
      <p class="topic">Index Of Elements In Array</p>
      <p class="content">
        The index of an element in an array represents it's position in that array.
        The first element of an array has index 0 and it increases by one for
        the subsequent elements. So, the second element of the array is index 1,
         and the third element, index 2 and it follows. <br />
        <img
          src="ARRAY2.jpg"
          alt="image describing index of element in arrays"
        />
        <br />
        An index can also be assigned to an element by the programmer, and for
        this case, the index of the element next to that which an index was
        assigned to, gets +1 of the index that was assigned, still leaving the
        first element with index 0. For instance in the example below, index 5
        is assigned to element 4 making the subsequent elements have indices of
        +1 but leaving the index of the first element as 0. <br />
        <br />

        <br />
        <br />

      </p>
      <p class="italic">
        <em
          >Let us try and initialize an integer array called marks, assigning 56
          for the first element (i.e index 0), 88 for the second element, 46 for
          the third element, 69 for the forth element, and 70 for the last
          element.

        You can as well output the results by using a loop as follows. <br />
